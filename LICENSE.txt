You may use and modify this software for any non-commercial purpose within 
your educational institution, including making a reasonable number of copies. 
Teaching, academic research, and personal experimentation are examples of 
purposes which can be non-commercial. You may post copies on an internal 
secure server, and it may be installed and used on personal machines of

You may distribute snippets of this software in research papers, books or 
other teaching materials, or publish snippets of the software on websites 
or on-line community forums that are intended for teaching and research.  
The total amount of source code in each of your snippets should not 
exceed 50 lines.  If you wish to use a larger portion of the software,

You may not use or distribute this software or any derivative works in 
any form for commercial purposes. Examples of commercial purposes would

or distributing the software for use with commercial products.   
If you wish to commercialize your work related to the software or take 
part in research with industrial partners, you need to contact 
iplg@microsoft.com to enquire about a commercial license. 

You may distribute the software and modifications to the software for 
non-commercial purposes, but only to other eligible users of the 
software (for example, to another university student or professor to 
support joint academic research).  You may not grant rights to the 
software or derivative works that are broader than those provided 
by this license. For example, you may not distribute modifications 
of the software under terms that would permit commercial use, or under 
terms that purport to require the software or derivative works to be 
sublicensed to others.

You may use any information in intangible form that you remember after 
accessing the software. However, this right does not grant you a license 
to any of Microsoft's copyrights or patents for anything you might 
create using such information.  

In return for the license rights above, you must agree to these obligations: 

1.  You will not remove any copyright or other notices from the software, 
    nor reverse engineer or decompile binary portions of the software, 
    unless your laws give you the right to do so despite this restriction.

2.  You will include a verbatim copy of this license if you distribute 
    the software in any form.

3.  If you distribute derivative works of the software in source code 
    form you will do so only under this license, and if you distribute 
    derivative works of the software solely in object form you will do so 
    only under a license that complies with this license.

4.  If you have modified the software or created derivative works, 
    and distribute such modifications or derivative works, you will cause 
    the modified files to carry prominent notices describing your changes 
    and the date of the changes, so that recipients know that they are not 
    receiving the original software.

5.  Microsoft welcomes your comments and suggestions on the source code, 
    which you provide on a strictly voluntary basis.  If you give Microsoft 
    comments and suggestions regarding bug fixes, enhancements or other 
    modifications to the source code, you agree that Microsoft may, 
    in connection with Microsoft products and services use, disclose or 
    otherwise commercialize your comments and suggestions entirely without 
    any obligation or restriction based on intellectual property rights or 
    otherwise.  You will not give any comments or suggestions that you have 
    reason to believe are subject to any patent, copyright, or other 
    intellectual property claim or right of any third party.

6.  THE SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. THIS MEANS NO EXPRESS, 
    IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES 
    OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY WARRANTY 
    OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU MUST PASS THIS DISCLAIMER ON WHENEVER 
    YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.

7.  MICROSOFT WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE 
    OR THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL 
    OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT THE LAW PERMITS, NO MATTER 
    WHAT LEGAL THEORY IT IS BASED ON. YOU MUST PASS THIS LIMITATION OF 
    LIABILITY ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.

8.  If you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to the software 
    or anyone's use of the software, your license to the software ends 
    immediately.

9.  You will not use the software to aid the development of any software 
    programs that are designed to: 
    (a) harm or intentionally interfere with the operation of a computer 
        system including any data or information stored on such computer 
        system; and/or 
    (b) surreptitiously gain or maintain high level access to a computer 
        system, self-propagate, and/or execute in a manner that prevents 
        detection, including but not limited to, so-called “rootkit” 
        software programs, viruses, or worms.

10.  Your rights under the license end immediately if you breach it 
     in any way.
